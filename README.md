# Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

Hello, my name is Anel Canto. This repository contains my progress through the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial found at [React Official Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

## About the Tutorial

The Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial is designed for those who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible. If you're interested in a step-by-step approach, starting with 'Describing the UI' is recommended. Too see a more detailed description of the original tutorial check [the original readme](original-tutorial-readme).

The tutorial covers several fundamental aspects of React:

1. **Setup for the Tutorial** - provides a starting point to follow the tutorial.
2. **Overview** - teaches the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
3. **Completing the Game** - explores the most common techniques in React development.
4. **Adding Time Travel** - offers a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.

In this tutorial, I'm building an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

## Current Progress

Currently, I'm working through the tutorial as part of my coursework. You can follow my progress in the code files contained within this repository.
